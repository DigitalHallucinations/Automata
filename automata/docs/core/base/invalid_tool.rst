InvalidTool
===========

``InvalidTool`` is a class that is used when an invalid tool name is
encountered by an agent. It inherits from the ``BaseTool`` class and is
designed to handle instances where the agent is unable to find a valid
tool based on the given inputs. Since ``InvalidTool`` inherits from
``BaseTool``, it has similar methods that deal with running a function
or a coroutine depending on the specified input.

Overview
--------

The primary purpose of ``InvalidTool`` is to provide a fallback
mechanism for the agent when it fails to find or load a valid tool. It
ensures that the agent can continue to execute without crashing due to
an error in the tool name or other issues with tool loading.

-  ``automata.core.agent.agent.AutomataAgent``

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of
``InvalidTool``. However, it is important to note that the
``InvalidTool`` should not be explicitly used, as the agent should
automatically take care of handling invalid tool names internally.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.base.tool import InvalidTool

   invalid_tool = InvalidTool()

Limitations
-----------

``InvalidTool`` is designed to handle invalid tool names gracefully, but
it does not resolve the underlying issue causing the tool name to be
invalid. An invalid tool name could be due to a missing or unregistered
tool, a typo in the name, or some other problem. Debugging the root
cause of the invalid tool name would require additional investigation.

It is also important to remember that ``InvalidTool`` does not provide
any useful functionality beyond handling errors related to invalid
tools. It is not designed to replace the functionality of properly
implemented and registered tools.

-  How can we debug and fix issues with invalid tool names?
-  What is the process for registering a new tool to prevent the use of
   InvalidTool?
