Node
====

``Node`` is an abstract base class representing a node in a file tree.
It is part of the larger file management infrastructure in the
``automata.core.coding.directory`` package. The class includes a
``name`` to represent the name of the node and a ``parent`` to point to
the parent node in the file tree hierarchy.

----------------

-  ``automata.core.coding.directory.File``
-  ``automata.core.coding.directory.Directory``

Usage Example:
--------------

The ``Node`` class is not directly instantiated but is a superclass for
``File`` and ``Directory`` classes. Here is an example of how to use the
``File`` and ``Directory`` classes representing files and directories in
the file tree:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.coding.directory import File, Directory

   # Create a root directory and some subdirectories
   root = Directory("root")
   subdir1 = Directory("subdir1", root)
   subdir2 = Directory("subdir2", root)

   # Create some files in root directory
   file1 = File("file1.txt", root)
   file2 = File("file2.txt", root)

   # Create some files in subdirectories
   subdir1_file1 = File("file1.txt", subdir1)
   subdir1_file2 = File("file2.txt", subdir1)
   subdir2_file1 = File("file1.txt", subdir2)

   # Add files and subdirectories to root and subdirectories
   root.add_child(subdir1)
   root.add_child(subdir2)
   root.add_child(file1)
   root.add_child(file2)
   subdir1.add_child(subdir1_file1)
   subdir1.add_child(subdir1_file2)
   subdir2.add_child(subdir2_file1)

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  In the usage example, the file names are given manually. Is there an
   automated mechanism to traverse directories and create ``File`` and
   ``Directory`` objects?
