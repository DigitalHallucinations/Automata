DirectoryManager
================

``DirectoryManager`` is a utility class that handles operations related
to directory structures. It provides methods to create directories, get
the list of files in a given directory, and get the list of
subdirectories in a given directory.

Overview
--------

``DirectoryManager`` is initialized with a base path of the directory
structure, which is then used in various methods to perform operations
on directories and their contents. To create a directory manager
instance:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.coding.directory import DirectoryManager
   dm = DirectoryManager("/path/to/base/directory")

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.core.coding.directory.Directory``
-  ``automata.core.coding.directory.File``
-  ``automata.core.coding.directory.Node``

Example
-------

The following examples demonstrate how to use ``DirectoryManager`` to
create a directory and retrieve the list of files and subdirectories in
a given directory.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.coding.directory import DirectoryManager

   # Creating a new directory
   base_path = "/path/to/base/directory"
   dm = DirectoryManager(base_path)
   dm.ensure_directory_exists("new_directory")

   # Retrieving the list of files and subdirectories in a given directory
   files = dm.get_files_in_dir("new_directory")
   subdirs = dm.get_subdirectories("new_directory")
   print("Files:", files)
   print("Subdirectories:", subdirs)

Limitations
-----------

``DirectoryManager`` has some limitations:

-  It assumes a specific directory structure based on the base path
   provided during initialization.
-  It does not provide any error handling for incorrect or inaccessible
   paths. If the path is incorrect or not accessible, the functions may
   fail with unclear error messages.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there any additional methods that would be useful for a
   DirectoryManager class?
-  How can error handling be improved to provide clearer error messages
   when dealing with incorrect or inaccessible paths?
