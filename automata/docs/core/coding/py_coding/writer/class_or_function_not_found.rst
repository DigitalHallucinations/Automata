PyCodeWriter
============

``PyCodeWriter`` is a utility class for writing Python code along AST
nodes. It builds on the ``PyCodeRetriever`` object and provides various
methods for creating, updating, and deleting modules. The
``PyCodeWriter`` class can be extended to write documentation for Python
modules and execute code generation tasks.

Overview
--------

The main functionality of ``PyCodeWriter`` is centered around creating,
updating, and deleting Python modules using AST nodes. It provides
methods to perform these actions, such as ``create_new_module``,
``delete_from_existing_module``, and ``update_existing_module``. The
class is initialized with a ``PyCodeRetriever`` instance that retrieves
Python code from modules and objects.

Related Symbols

-  ``PyCodeRetriever``
-  ``automata.tests.unit.test_py_writer.MockCodeGenerator``

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of
``PyCodeWriter`` with a ``PyCodeRetriever`` instance:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.coding.py_coding.retriever import PyCodeRetriever
   from automata.core.coding.py_coding.writer import PyCodeWriter
   from automata.core.coding.directory import DirectoryManager

   py_retriever = PyCodeRetriever(DirectoryManager().module_tree_map)
   code_writer = PyCodeWriter(py_retriever)

Limitations
-----------

``PyCodeWriter`` assumes that the provided module paths have the given
structure and can only work on modules with that structure. This makes
it less flexible for working with different modulesâ€™ structures.

Follow-up Questions
-------------------

-  Are there any plans to extend support for custom module structures in
   the future?
