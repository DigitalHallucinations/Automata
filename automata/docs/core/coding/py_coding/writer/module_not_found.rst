PyCodeWriter
============

``PyCodeWriter`` is a utility class for writing Python code along
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes. It provides methods for creating,
updating, deleting, and manipulating source code in existing Python
modules, as well as generating documentation. Working alongside the
``PyCodeRetriever``, the ``PyCodeWriter`` allows for seamless
manipulation and extraction of Python code.

Overview
--------

The main functionality of ``PyCodeWriter`` is to work with source code
within Python modules. It uses a ``PyCodeRetriever`` instance to handle
code retrieval and manipulation. With this class, you can create new
modules, update and delete from existing modules, and manage docstrings
and import statements. Given the highly abstract nature of AST nodes, it
is useful for code introspection and source-to-source transformations.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of
``PyCodeWriter`` and use it to create a new module.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.coding.py_coding.retriever import PyCodeRetriever
   from automata.core.coding.py_coding.writer import PyCodeWriter

   python_retriever = PyCodeRetriever()  # create a PyCodeRetriever instance
   code_writer = PyCodeWriter(python_retriever)  # initialize PyCodeWriter with the PyCodeRetriever instance

   source_code = """def foo():
       return 'Hello, world!'
   """
   code_writer.create_new_module("sample_module", source_code, do_write=True)

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of the ``PyCodeWriter`` is that it assumes source
code is structured in a certain way and adheres to certain coding
patterns. It may not handle edge cases or unconventional coding
structures well, resulting in either unexpected behavior or loss of
functionality. An example of such a limitation is the handling of
character encodings.
