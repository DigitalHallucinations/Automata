ResultAction
============

``ResultAction`` is a class that represents an action returned as a
result from the ``AutomataActionExtractor`` class. This action is based
on the input specification provided and consists of a result name and a
list of output values associated with that result. It provides methods
to initialize the instance, generate a string representation of the
instance, and create a ``ResultAction`` instance from a list of lines
provided as input.

Overview
--------

``ResultAction`` instances are used to represent actions returned by the
``AutomataActionExtractor``. The class provides an interface to create,
manage, and manipulate the results in a structured manner. The primary
methods include the initialization of the instance, constructing the
string representation, and creating a ``ResutlAction`` instance from a
list of lines.

-  ``automata.core.agent.action.AutomataActionExtractor``
-  ``automata.core.agent.agent_enums.ActionIndicator``
-  ``automata.core.agent.action.Action``

Example
-------

Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating how to create and use a ``ResultAction``
instance:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.agent.action import ResultAction

   result_name = "ExampleResult"
   result_outputs = ["This is an example output"]

   result_action = ResultAction(result_name, result_outputs)

   print(result_action)
   # Output: ResultAction(name=ExampleResult, outputs=['This is an example output'])

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of ``ResultAction`` is its reliance on the
``AutomataActionExtractor`` class and the line-based input provided to
create an instance of the class. It assumes certain line structures for
parsing and constructing the instance.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there any other methods or attributes needed for ``ResultAction``
   to improve its functionality and ease of use?
-  How can the parsing of lines provided as input be improved to
   accommodate varying input structure formats?
