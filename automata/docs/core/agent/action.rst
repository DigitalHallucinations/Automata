Action
======

``Action`` is an abstract base class representing an action that an
Automata Agent may perform. Subclasses of this class implement various
operation types and methods for converting the actions to and from a
string representation in the AutomataActions configuration.

Overview
--------

A class derived from ``Action`` must implement the ``__str__()`` method,
which returns a human-readable string representation of the action, and
the ``from_lines()`` class method to create an instance of the Action
subclass from a list of lines and an index.

``Action`` is a crucial element of the Automata Agent framework as it
helps define the behavior of an agent when executing instructions.

Example
-------

Hereâ€™s an example of a simple custom action called ``PrintHelloAction``:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.agent.action import Action

   class PrintHelloAction(Action):
       
       def __str__(self):
           return "PrintHelloAction"
         
       @classmethod
       def from_lines(cls, lines, index):
           return cls()

Limitations
-----------

Some limitations of the ``Action`` base class are:

-  Currently, it supports only string-based representations of actions.
   In the future, support for additional data types or formats might be
   necessary.
-  The parsing and conversion process assumes a specific AutomataActions
   configuration structure, which could cause issues if the format
   changes.
-  Custom actions must be implemented as subclasses, which might make it
   difficult for some users to create their own actions easily.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are other data types or formats planned to be supported by the
   ``Action`` class and its subclasses?
-  Should the parsing and conversion process be more general or be
   adapted to different configuration formats?
