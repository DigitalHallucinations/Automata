ToolField
=========

``ToolField`` is an enumeration that represents the fields of a tool,
which are part of the ``automata.core.agent.agent_enums`` module. This
enum is used in the context of ``automata.core.agent.agent`` and other
related classes and methods.

Overview
--------

``ToolField`` is a simple enumeration that provides a way to identify
the various fields of a tool. It is mainly used to help users navigate
and work with the different properties of a tool when implementing
agent-related features, like managing interactions between tools.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.core.symbol.symbol_types.Symbol``
-  ``automata.core.agent.agent.AutomataAgent``
-  ``automata.core.base.tool.Tool``
-  ``automata.core.agent.agent_enums.AgentField``

Example
-------

You generally wonâ€™t be working directly with ``ToolField`` in your
implementation. However, in case you need to reference a tool field
while working with agent-related classes or methods, you can do so as
shown below:

.. code:: python

   from enum import Enum
   from automata.core.agent.agent_enums import ToolField

   tool_field_example = ToolField.Name
   print(tool_field_example)

Limitations
-----------

``ToolField`` is a basic enumeration with a limited scope and purpose.
Its primary use is for internally organizing and referencing the fields
of a tool. The enumeration itself does not provide any methods or
additional functionality beyond identifying the fields.

--------------------

-  Are there any other uses for ToolField besides internally organizing
   and referencing fields of a tool?
