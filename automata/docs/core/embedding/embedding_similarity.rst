EmbeddingSimilarity
===================

``EmbeddingSimilarity`` is an abstract base class that provides an
interface for finding the most similar symbols to a given query text in
a codebase. It relies on embeddings, which are numerical representations
of text data. Given a query, EmbeddingSimilarity computes the similarity
between this query and the existing symbols in the codebase and returns
the results. The primary methods in this class are
``get_nearest_entries_for_query`` and ``get_query_similarity_dict``.
Implementations of this class provide the functionality for different
types of similarity calculations and embedding providers.

Example
-------

Below is an example demonstrating how to create a custom implementation
of ``EmbeddingSimilarity``:

.. code:: python

   import numpy as np
   from automata.core.embedding.embedding_types import EmbeddingSimilarity

   class CustomEmbeddingSimilarity(EmbeddingSimilarity):
       
       def __init__(self, embedding_handler):
           self.embedding_handler = embedding_handler
       
       def get_nearest_entries_for_query(self, query_text: str, k_nearest: int) -> Dict[Symbol, float]:
           # Implement custom logic to find k nearest entries
           pass
           
       def get_query_similarity_dict(self, query_text: str) -> Dict[Symbol, float]:
           # Implement custom logic to compute similarity between query and symbols
           pass

   # Create an instance
   embedding_handler = SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler(embedding_db, embedding_provider)
   custom_similarity = CustomEmbeddingSimilarity(embedding_handler)

Limitations
-----------

The ``EmbeddingSimilarity`` class itself serves as an interface for the
specific implementations, which allows for different approaches to
calculate similarity. The primary issue here is that those
implementations can handle different types of embeddings and similarity
calculations, so choosing or creating the correct one is crucial for
achieving accurate results. Also, depending on the chosen embedding
provider, the quality and speed of retrieving embeddings could vary. As
it is an abstract class, it cannot be instantiated directly and requires
implementation of its methods.

-  How can we optimize the performance of similarity calculations for
   large codebases?
