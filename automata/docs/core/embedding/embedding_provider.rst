EmbeddingProvider
=================

``EmbeddingProvider`` is an abstract base class that provides an
interface for obtaining embeddings for symbols. Embeddings are
mathematical representations of symbols that can be used for various
tasks such as similarity search, ranking, and other natural language
processing related work. The class contains a single abstract method,
``build_embedding``, which should be implemented by all subclasses to
provide the specific embedding implementation.

Example
-------

The following is an example of how to use the ``OpenAIEmbedding`` class,
which is a concrete implementation of ``EmbeddingProvider``.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.embedding.embedding_types import OpenAIEmbedding
   import numpy as np

   symbol_source = "This is an example of a Python function."
   embedding_provider = OpenAIEmbedding() 
   embedding = embedding_provider.build_embedding(symbol_source)

   # Check if the generated embedding is a numpy array
   assert isinstance(embedding, np.ndarray)

Limitations
-----------

As ``EmbeddingProvider`` is an abstract base class, it cannot be
instantiated directly. Users must create their own classes that inherit
from ``EmbeddingProvider`` and implement the necessary methods. This can
be a limitation for users who are not familiar with creating custom
classes and implementing abstract methods.

Additionally, the specific embedding approach and model used by a
concrete implementation of ``EmbeddingProvider`` may limit the overall
performance and accuracy of the embeddings.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can we efficiently implement new embedding providers for
   different types of models?
-  What are the best practices for selecting an optimal embedding
   provider for a given task?
