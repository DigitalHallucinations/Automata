SymbolFile
==========

``SymbolFile`` is a class that represents a file that contains a symbol.
It provides methods to perform equality checks and hashing operations on
a file. This class is primarily used within the ``SymbolGraph`` to
represent files containing symbols.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to use the ``SymbolFile`` class
to create an instance of a file containing a symbol and compare it with
another instance.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.symbol.symbol_types import SymbolFile

   file_1 = SymbolFile("path/to/symbol/file")
   file_2 = SymbolFile("path/to/symbol/file")

   # Comparing SymbolFile instances
   assert file_1 == file_2

   # Comparing SymbolFile instance with a string representing the path
   assert file_1 == "path/to/symbol/file"

Limitations
-----------

``SymbolFile`` is a simple class and focuses on providing a way to
represent files containing symbols. It does not provide methods to
modify the file or access the symbol within the file.

-  What is the process to access the symbol within a ``SymbolFile``
   instance?
