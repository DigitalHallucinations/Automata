SymbolRank
==========

``SymbolRank`` is a class that computes the PageRank algorithm on
symbols in a graph. It takes a directed graph as input and calculates
the SymbolRanks of each node in the graph. It provides a way to rank the
relevance of symbols in a given graph based on their connectivity and
usage.

Overview
--------

The ``SymbolRank`` class is used to calculate the symbol ranks for a
directed graph. It uses the PageRank algorithm to assign a rank value to
each symbol in the graph based on their connections and usage. This
ranking can be used to determine the importance of symbols in various
contexts, such as symbol search, code analysis, and documentation
generation.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of
``SymbolRank`` and calculate the symbol ranks for a simple directed
graph.

.. code:: python

   import networkx as nx
   from automata.core.symbol.search.rank import SymbolRank

   # Create a simple directed graph
   G = nx.DiGraph()
   G.add_edge(1, 2)
   G.add_edge(2, 3)
   G.add_edge(3, 1)

   # Initialize SymbolRank with the graph
   symbol_rank = SymbolRank(G)

   # Calculate SymbolRanks for the graph
   ranks = symbol_rank.get_ranks()

   print(ranks)

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of the ``SymbolRank`` class is that it only
supports directed graphs with symbols as nodes. Additionally, the
convergence of the power iteration used by the PageRank algorithm is not
guaranteed for all graphs.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Is there a way to make the SymbolRank algorithm more efficient for
   larger graphs?
