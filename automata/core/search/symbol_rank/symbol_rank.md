# SymbolRank Documentation

SymbolRank is an innovative search algorithm for code that leverages the power of embedding representations and the PageRank algorithm to rank symbols in a codebase based on their relevance to a given query.

## Overview

SymbolRank operates in the following key steps:

Embedding Generation: The source code for each symbol in the codebase is mapped to a high-dimensional embedding representation. This mapping captures the context and usage of each symbol.

Symbol Similarity Calculation: Given a code query, SymbolRank calculates the similarity of each symbol's embedding to the query. This results in a dictionary mapping symbols to similarity scores.

Graph Construction: A bidirectional graph of the codebase is constructed, where nodes represent symbols and edges represent dependencies between symbols.

PageRank Application: SymbolRank applies the PageRank algorithm with preferences specified by the z-score of the symbol similarity scores, using the graph structure to determine the final ranking of symbols.

## Key Components

EmbeddingsProvider
The EmbeddingsProvider class is responsible for generating the high-dimensional embeddings for each symbol.

```
class EmbeddingsProvider:
    ...
    def get_embedding(self, symbol_source: str) -> np.ndarray:
    ...
SymbolEmbeddingMap
The SymbolEmbeddingMap class is used to store the mappings from symbols to their embeddings.
```

```
class SymbolEmbeddingMap:
    ...
    def get_embedding_dict(self) -> Dict[Symbol, SymbolEmbedding]:
        ...
SymbolSimilarity
The SymbolSimilarity class is used to calculate similarity scores between a given query and all symbols.
```

```
class SymbolSimilarity:
    ...
    def generate_similarity_matrix(self, norm_type: Optional[str] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    ...
    def get_query_similarity_dict(self, query_text: str, norm_type: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[Symbol, float]:
    ...
```

SymbolRank
Finally, the SymbolRank class combines the symbol similarity scores with the graph structure of the codebase to apply the PageRank algorithm, ranking symbols based on their relevance to the query.

python

```
class SymbolRank:
...
def get_ranks(
self,
symbol_similarity: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None,
initial_weights: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None,
dangling: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None,
) -> List[Tuple[str, float]]:
...
```

## Discussion

The SymbolRank algorithm offers a highly nuanced and potentially very effective approach to code search. By combining semantic symbol embeddings with the PageRank algorithm, it not only captures the context and usage of each symbol, but also accounts for the interconnectivity and dependencies between different parts of a codebase.

One should be aware of the following considerations when implementing SymbolRank:

Embedding Training: The quality of the embeddings plays a crucial role in the performance of SymbolRank. It is recommended to pretrain the embedding model on a large codebase and then fine-tune it on your specific codebase. Also, as the codebase evolves, it is crucial to revisit and retrain these models.
Handling Change: Codebases often change and evolve. It is crucial to update the symbol embeddings and the graph structure to account for these changes.
Query Formulation: Consider how users will formulate their queries. You might need different approaches for code chunks versus natural language queries.
Evaluation Metrics: To measure the success of your search, consider using metrics like Precision at K, Mean Average Precision (MAP), or Normalized
