LoggingConfig
=============

``LoggingConfig`` is a class that represents the logging configuration
for the Automata Docs package. It allows you to configure the logging
settings to suit your specific needs, while providing a default logging
configuration that serves as a basis for most use cases.

Overview
--------

``LoggingConfig`` is a dictionary that contains various settings and
values that control the logging behavior in the package. By customizing
the ``LoggingConfig``, you can adjust log levels, enable/disable
handlers, and ensure that your logging infrastructure works as intended
in different circumstances.

Related Symbols

-  ``automata_docs.cli.commands.LoggingConfig``
-  ``automata_docs.core.utils.HandlerDict``
-  ``automata_docs.core.utils.RootDict``
-  ``automata_docs.cli.commands.HandlerDict``

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of
``LoggingConfig``.

.. code:: python

   from automata_docs.core.utils import LoggingConfig

   logging_config = LoggingConfig()

Limitations
-----------

``LoggingConfig`` is limited in that it only provides a dictionary
structure for representing the configuration. Youâ€™ll need to work with
other parts of the logging system or use additional tools to make
changes to the logging infrastructure more effectively.
