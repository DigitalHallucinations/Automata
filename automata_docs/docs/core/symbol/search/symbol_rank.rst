SymbolRank
==========

``SymbolRank`` computes the PageRank algorithm on symbols in a graph. It
takes a directed graph and an optional ``SymbolRankConfig`` as input,
and calculates the SymbolRanks of each node in the graph. The class
provides methods for processing the graph, preparing initial ranks, and
calculating SymbolRanks.

Overview
--------

``SymbolRank`` is useful for ranking symbols in a software system, such
as methods, classes, and variables, based on their importance in the
systemâ€™s call graph. It can also be used for search and recommendation
tasks, by providing a ranked list of symbols based on their relevancy
and importance in the system. Using the PageRank algorithm, it
identifies the most important symbols in the graph, taking into account
the structure of the graph and the relationships between symbols.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to use ``SymbolRank`` to compute
the SymbolRanks for a given directed graph ``G`` and
``SymbolRankConfig`` ``config``.

.. code:: python

   import networkx as nx
   from automata_docs.core.symbol.search.rank import SymbolRank
   from automata_docs.core.symbol.search.rank import SymbolRankConfig

   # Define a directed graph G (nodes and edges should be added in practice)
   G = nx.DiGraph()

   # Create a SymbolRankConfig
   config = SymbolRankConfig()

   # Instantiate a SymbolRank object
   pagerank = SymbolRank(G, config=config)

   # Calculate SymbolRanks
   ranks = pagerank.get_ranks()

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of ``SymbolRank`` is its reliance on the PageRank
algorithm, which has some known shortcomings, such as high computation
costs for large graphs and sensitivity to graph structure. Additionally,
``SymbolRank`` assumes a specific graph representation using the
NetworkX library, limiting its applicability to other graph
representations.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there alternative ranking algorithms that can be used in addition
   to PageRank for ranking symbols in a graph?
-  Can ``SymbolRank`` be extended to support other graph representations
   beyond NetworkX?
