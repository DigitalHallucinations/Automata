SymbolRank
==========

``SymbolRank`` is a class that computes the PageRank algorithm on
symbols in a graph. Given a directed graph and an optional
configuration, it calculates the ranks of each node in the graph and
returns a sorted list of tuples containing the symbol and its
corresponding rank.

Use ``SymbolRank`` for applications where you need to rank symbols in a
graph based on their importance or relevance.

Overview
--------

``SymbolRank`` takes in a directed graph and an optional configuration,
and provides a method ``get_ranks`` to calculate the rank for each node
in the graph. ``get_ranks`` can also be supplied with optional
dictionaries for query-to-symbol similarity, initial weights, and
dangling nodes.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to use the ``SymbolRank`` class
to calculate the ranks of nodes in a graph.

.. code:: python

   import networkx as nx
   from automata_docs.core.symbol.search.rank import SymbolRank
   from automata_docs.core.symbol.search.rank import SymbolRankConfig

   # Create a directed graph
   G = nx.DiGraph()
   G.add_edge(1, 2)
   G.add_edge(2, 3)
   G.add_edge(3, 1)

   # Create a SymbolRankConfig object
   config = SymbolRankConfig()

   # Initialize the SymbolRank object with the graph and configuration
   pagerank = SymbolRank(G, config)

   # Calculate the ranks of nodes in the graph
   ranks = pagerank.get_ranks()

   # Display the computed ranks
   print(ranks)

Limitations
-----------

The main limitation of ``SymbolRank`` is that it relies on the NetworkX
library for graph operations, which may have certain performance
constraints. Moreover, setting up the graph and configuring the
``SymbolRank`` object requires some understanding of the underlying
algorithms and representation of symbols.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Is there any specific guidance on how to prepare the input graph for
   optimal results?
-  Are there any performance metrics or benchmarks available for this
   implementation?
