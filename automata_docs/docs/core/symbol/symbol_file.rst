SymbolFile
==========

``SymbolFile`` represents a file that contains a symbol and is an object
utilized in the Symbol Information package to manage file and symbol
relationships. It provides the necessary structure for searching,
indexing, and managing symbols in a file and includes closely related
symbols like ``Symbol``, ``SymbolGraph``, and others.

Overview
--------

``SymbolFile`` acts as an identifier for a file containing symbols. It
is primarily used for determining whether two ``SymbolFile`` objects
reference the same file in the context of symbolic operations. The class
has a simple structure, including a class docstring and two main
methods, namely ``__eq__`` and ``__hash__``.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata_docs.core.symbol.symbol_types.Symbol``
-  ``automata_docs.core.symbol.graph.SymbolGraph``
-  ``automata_docs.core.symbol.symbol_types.SymbolReference``
-  ``automata_docs.core.database.vector.JSONVectorDatabase``
-  ``automata_docs.core.symbol.parser.parse_symbol``

Example
-------

In this example, we will instantiate a ``SymbolFile`` object and compare
it to another ``SymbolFile`` object and a string.

.. code:: python

   from automata_docs.core.symbol.symbol_types import SymbolFile

   file1 = SymbolFile("path/to/file1.py")
   file2 = SymbolFile("path/to/file1.py")

   print(file1 == file2)  # True
   print(file1 == "path/to/file1.py")  # True

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of ``SymbolFile`` is that it relies only on the
file path to determine equality. If two files have different paths but
contain the same symbols, ``SymbolFile`` cannot handle this case.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can we handle the case where two files with different paths
   contain the same symbols?
-  Is there a way to extend the utility of this class by adding more
   functionality to handle file contents?
