File
====

``File`` is a class that represents a file in a tree. It inherits from
the abstract base class ``Node`` and provides an initialization method
for providing a file name and an optional parent node.

Overview
--------

``File`` is useful for representing tree structures, such as directories
and file hierarchies. By providing a name and optional parent ``Node``,
the ``File`` instance can be linked to other nodes to form a tree.

-  ``automata_docs.core.coding.directory.Node``

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create instances of the
``File`` class:

.. code:: python

   from automata_docs.core.coding.directory import File

   file1 = File("file1.txt")
   file2 = File("file2.txt", parent=file1)

In this example, ``file1`` is created with the name ``"file1.txt"`` and
no parent node. ``file2`` is created with the name ``"file2.txt"`` and
``file1`` as its parent node.

Limitations
-----------

The ``File`` class is minimal and may not cover the full range of file
system operations. It currently only supports constructing instances
with a name and optional parent node.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there any additional methods or functionalities for the ``File``
   class that should be included in the documentation?

*NOTE:* In the examples and descriptions above, the ``Mock`` objects in
test files from the context have been omitted or replaced with actual
underlying objects, as appropriate. If there are any remaining
references to ``Mock`` objects not explicitly mentioned, they are used
in testing to simplify working with complex objects.
