File
====

``File`` is a class that represents a file in a tree structure. It
extends the abstract ``Node`` class and helps in maintaining a
hierarchical structure that represents the relationship between files
and their parent directories.

Overview
--------

The ``File`` class is primarily used for organizing files in a tree-like
structure. It helps handle files in a directory with their parent nodes
being directories, allowing for easy traversal and manipulation of the
file structure.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates the usage of the ``File`` class.

.. code:: python

   from automata_docs.core.coding.directory import Directory, File

   root_directory = Directory("root")
   file1 = File("file1.txt", parent=root_directory)
   file2 = File("file2.txt", parent=root_directory)

   print(root_directory.children)  # Output: [file1, file2]

Limitations
-----------

``File`` only represents a file and cannot store or manipulate the
contents of the underlying file. To perform I/O operations or other
manipulations, you need to use the ``SymbolFile`` class or other I/O
libraries in conjunction with ``File``.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there any methods or examples for how to perform I/O operations
   using the ``File`` class?
