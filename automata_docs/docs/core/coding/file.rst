File
====

``File`` is a class that represents a file in the file tree. It inherits
from the abstract base class ``Node``.

Overview
--------

The ``File`` class provides a way to represent a file in a file tree,
including its name and parent node. This class is useful when working
with file trees for managing, navigating, or analyzing file structure in
a directory.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of
``File``.

.. code:: python

   from automata_docs.core.coding.directory import File

   file_name = "example.txt"
   parent_node = None

   new_file = File(file_name, parent_node)

Limitations
-----------

The ``File`` class is primarily a basic representation of a file within
a file tree. It does not provide built-in functionality for reading or
writing contents, modifying file attributes, or traversing the file
tree. For these operations, additional functionality may need to be
developed or other Python libraries may be employed.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What are some ways to improve the class to provide additional
   functionality for manipulating the files?
-  How can we incorporate file reading and writing capabilities within
   this class?
