DirectoryManager
================

``DirectoryManager`` is a class that handles operations related to
directory structures such as ensuring a directory exists, getting files
in a directory, and getting subdirectories. It provides functionality to
manage and interact with the directory structure, ensuring proper
organization and structure.

Overview
--------

``DirectoryManager`` provides methods for interacting with the directory
structure, such as creating directories or getting lists of files or
subdirectories. The class is initialized with a base path, which will be
the starting point for the directory structure. It includes methods like
``ensure_directory_exists``, ``get_files_in_dir``, and
``get_subdirectories``. It also includes related symbols like
``Directory`` and tests for the methods in the ``DirectoryManager``.

Example
-------

The following is an example demonstrating how to create a
``DirectoryManager`` instance for a given directory path, create a new
directory, and retrieve files and subdirectories in a given path.

.. code:: python

   from automata_docs.core.coding.directory import DirectoryManager

   base_path = "/path/to/base/directory"
   dir_manager = DirectoryManager(base_path)

   new_directory_path = "/path/to/base/directory/new_directory"
   dir_manager.ensure_directory_exists(new_directory_path)

   files_in_dir = dir_manager.get_files_in_dir(new_directory_path)
   print("Files in the directory:", files_in_dir)

   subdirectories = dir_manager.get_subdirectories(new_directory_path)
   print("Subdirectories in the directory:", subdirectories)

Limitations
-----------

``DirectoryManager`` assumes a specific directory structure for the base
path and relies on the ``Directory`` class for many of its operations.
It is also limited in functionality, primarily providing methods for
creating directories and retrieving files or subdirectories.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Can ``DirectoryManager`` be expanded to manage complex directory
   structures and additional filesystem operations?
