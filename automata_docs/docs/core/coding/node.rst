Node
====

``Node`` is an abstract base class for a node in the file tree within a
directory structure. It provides a base structure for representing files
and directories as nodes with name and parent node information.

-  ``automata_docs.core.coding.directory.Directory``

Example
-------

The following is an example demonstrating how to create an instance of a
``Directory`` object, which inherits from the ``Node`` class:

.. code:: python

   from automata_docs.core.coding.directory import Directory

   directory = Directory(name="example_directory", parent=None)

Similarly, you can create an instance of a ``File`` object:

.. code:: python

   from automata_docs.core.coding.directory import File

   file_node = File(name="example_file.txt", parent=directory)

Limitations
-----------

The ``Node`` class does not provide any methods or functionality for
working with the file system. It only serves as a data structure to
represent directories and files within a larger tree structure.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can we modify the ``Node`` class to work more closely with the
   file system, including reading and writing files?

Note: In the provided context, there are references to ‘Mock’ objects
used in test files. As these are testing-specific objects, their
inclusion in the examples and discussion has been omitted.
