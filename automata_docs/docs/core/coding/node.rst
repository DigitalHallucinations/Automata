Node
====

``Node`` is an abstract base class for a node in the file tree used in
the Automata documentation project. It represents a generic node in a
file system hierarchy, allowing you to work with files and directories
in a generic and hierarchical manner.

Overview
--------

The ``Node`` class serves as a base class for other types of file tree
nodes, such as ``File`` and ``Directory``. It has two main attributes,
``name`` and ``parent``, and provides a constructor for initializing
them. By inheriting from the Node class, the ``File`` and ``Directory``
classes can easily represent and manipulate their hierarchical
relationship in the file tree.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create a custom class that
inherits from the ``Node`` class and initialize it with a name and
parent:

.. code:: python

   from automata_docs.core.coding.directory import Node
   from typing import Optional

   class CustomNode(Node):
       def __init__(self, name: str, parent: Optional["Node"] = None):
           super().__init__(name, parent)

   # Create an instance of CustomNode
   custom_node = CustomNode("example_node", None)

Limitations
-----------

``Node`` is an abstract base class and can’t be instantiated directly;
you need to subclass it to create your custom node types, such as files
or directories. It doesn’t provide any specific functionality for file
or directory nodes apart from the ``name`` and ``parent`` attributes.
The logic and functionality specific to files and directories are
implemented in their respective subclasses (``File`` and ``Directory``).

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What other features and functionality should be included in the base
   ``Node`` class?
-  How does the ``Node`` class interact with other components of the
   Automata documentation project?
