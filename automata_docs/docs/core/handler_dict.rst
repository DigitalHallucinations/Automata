HandlerDict
===========

``HandlerDict`` is a dictionary representing a logging handler. It is
closely related to ``RootDict``, ``LoggingConfig``, and classes that
handle logging configurations and settings. This class is a part of the
``automata_docs.core.utils`` module and is mainly utilized for creating
logging handlers for the logging configuration.

Overview
--------

``HandlerDict`` is a specialized dictionary that allows managing and
representing a logging handler, with a main purpose of storing the
configuration details related to a logging handler. It is commonly used
in conjunction with other logging-related classes, such as ``RootDict``
(which represents the root logger) and ``LoggingConfig`` (a dictionary
that represents the entire logging configuration).

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata_docs.core.utils.RootDict``
-  ``automata_docs.core.utils.LoggingConfig``

Example
-------

Here’s an example demonstrating how you can create an instance of
``HandlerDict`` and configure it with a custom logging handler:

.. code:: python

   from automata_docs.core.utils import HandlerDict

   handler_dict = HandlerDict({
       'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
       'level': 'DEBUG',
       'formatter': 'standard',
       'stream': 'ext://sys.stdout'
   })

Limitations
-----------

``HandlerDict`` is a simple dictionary subclass that’s specifically
tailored for representing a logging handler. It doesn’t offer any
additional functionality or methods beyond the basic dictionary
operations. It is relatively straightforward and lacks advanced features
for handling complex logging configurations, such as dynamic loading of
handler classes from modules or error handling in case of incorrect
handler setup.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Is there any additional functionality that should be implemented in
   ``HandlerDict`` to support more advanced use cases related to logging
   handlers?

-  What is the scope of usage of ``HandlerDict`` in the larger
   ``automata_docs`` project, and are there any potential areas where
   its functionality could be expanded upon?
