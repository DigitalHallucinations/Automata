RootDict
========

``RootDict`` is a dictionary that represents the root logger. It is an
integral part of the logging system, allowing the registration and
organization of loggers within the application. The loggers can be
useful in keeping track of the logs, error messages, and other
information during the applicationâ€™s run-time. This class serves as a
base dictionary for the root logger which can be customized or extended
by other classes to create specific loggers.

Example
-------

.. code:: python

   from automata_docs.core.utils import RootDict

   root_dict = RootDict()
   root_dict["level"] = "DEBUG"
   root_dict["handlers"] = ["console"]

   print(root_dict)  # {'level': 'DEBUG', 'handlers': ['console']}

Limitations
-----------

``RootDict`` by itself does not provide any logging functionality. It
serves as a building block for configuring the logging system by
allowing the definition of loggers. This class does not implement any
logging methods or inherently provide any form of logging. It must be
used in conjunction with other classes and configurations to set up the
logging system effectively.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What are some common use cases for extending the ``RootDict`` class?
-  Are there any specific recommended practices for using or extending
   ``RootDict`` for custom logging purposes?
