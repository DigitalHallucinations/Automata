  title: Optimize python_tools
  body: |
    The PythonTool kit exposes 4 functions across two unique tool builders, the functions are
    - python-parser-get-raw-code
    - python-parser-get-docstring
    - python-writer-modify-code-state
    - python-writer-write-to-disk
    These functions are to be used by an autonomous developer agent, and the tool is meant to be optimized for such a use case. 
    Your job is to inspect the code and come up with new essential functions for the agent, and to then implement them.
